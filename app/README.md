# ce-cli Sourcecode

This is the sourecode for ce-cli, a command line tool for helping to build Liferay Client extensions for the frontend.
The tool is built in Rust, so if you want to compile it yourself and you already have Rust installed, just run
`cargo install ce-cli` and you'll be good to go.

If you don't have Rust installed, you can install a precompiled binary using `npm install ce-cli`.
Note that some architectures may not be supported, so if this doesn't work for you just make an issue
and I'll see if I can't add it to the distribution list. No guarantees that I can do it, so in that case
it's best to just install the Rust toolchain and compile it specifically for your machine.
