# Changelog

## New Features

- Can generate a Shared Component -- a component that's bundled separately but not deployed as it's own app. It can be shared between multiple apps without being copied within each bundle.

## Changes

- Validation for project initializtion: must initialize in empty folder
- Validation for extension creation
  - reject special characters in extension name
  - will not create an extension if the folder already exists

## Bugfixes

- Previously adding hyphens in the name of a custom element would generate invalid JavaScript. This is fixed.
