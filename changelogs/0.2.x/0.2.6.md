# Changelog

## New Features

- Can generate a Shared Component -- a component that's bundled separately but not deployed as it's own app. It can be shared between multiple apps without being copied within each bundle.
- Can specify a virtual instance to deploy to, which is useful when developing against LXC as it makes your local
  environment closer to the deployment environment. Note that a bug in Liferay Workspace causes this to fail if you run
  `blade gw deploy` -- it just deploys to root instance. However, it does currently work for ce-cli's `dev-deploy`
  command, so you can still use it for your local development without any issues.

## Changes

- Validation for project initialization: must initialize in empty folder
- Validation for extension creation
  - reject special characters in extension name
  - will not create an extension if the folder already exists
- Refactor of command line parser configuration

## Bugfixes

- Previously adding hyphens in the name of a custom element would generate invalid JavaScript. This is fixed.
